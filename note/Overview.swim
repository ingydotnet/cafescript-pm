A block comment is made like this:

  ###
  Comment
  goes
  here.
  ###

This is stolen from CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript stole the idea of triples from
Python's `"""`, and made other multiline things from it like `///` for
multiline regexes and `###` for multiline comments. Markdown also uses triple
back-ticks for code blocks.
