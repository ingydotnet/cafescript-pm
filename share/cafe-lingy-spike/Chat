In CafeScript a file is a module. Generally it defines one or more classes.
Scope is indentation based or `{;}` based. A class needs no indentation (it
goes to EOF or next `Class` keyword.

Q: Where do you put the main code?
A: In a module, code before the first class is executed on Require. So a file
   with no class would run. Either that or a file with no class is the same as:

  Class Main
  \main argv
    …your code here…

Likely the latter since we need to deal with ARGV.

Q: Parens are optional?
A: They are the same as Ruby or CoffeeScript. http://coffeescript.org/

  foo bar, baz 1 → foo(bar, baz(1))

Q: I meant in the method header. \greet name vs. \main(argv)
A: I'm thinking of where you would need them:

  array.each \(elem)
    say elem

That's an anonymous function. I think we want them there.
